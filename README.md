# Magento-2-Price-Calculator

Basically, when there is any online store owner selling custom products where the calculation is required on the basis of mathematical formula and the calculation depends on the input entered by the customer and by default Magento 2 does not provide this functionality. Most probably all these products are sold based on the square foot and are unable to calculate the exact rate of these products. Therefore, to diminish all difficulties for the Magento 2 store owners MageComp has launched Magento 2 Price Calculator Extension.
